ATIS folder structure

data foler contains the datasets, jupyter notebook and python script for data preprocessing
- datasets sources: ATIS zipped folder (zipped data files), ATIS data sets folder (unzipped files)
- processed data: atis.pkl
- notebook: ATIS data processing.ipynb, shows the flow of data loading, preprocessing and saving
- python script: ATIS_data_preprocessing.py, execute this will generate usable datasets in the same folder

models folder contains checkpoint files for trained NER models on the processed Wikigold.conll datasets

NER on ATIS.ipynb (jupyter notebook): shows data loading, model construction, training and evaluation

NER_on_ATIS.py (python script): refactored from the notebook, has structured utility functions, the main section also constructs, trains and evaluates a NER model.


Starting from scratch:
1. go to data folder, execute ATIS_data_preprocessing.py to generate preprocessed data (already there by default)
2. execute NER_on_ATIS.py to build and evaluate a NER model on the ATIS data set
