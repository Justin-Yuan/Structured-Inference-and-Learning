POS folder structure

data foler contains the datasets, jupyter notebook and python script for data preprocessing
- datasets sources: train.txt, test.txt
- processed data: pos_conll.pkl
- notebook: Conll data processing.ipynb, shows the flow of data loading, preprocessing and saving
- python script: Conll_data_preprocessing.py, execute this will generate usable datasets in the same folder

models folder contains checkpoint files for trained POS tagging models on the processed Conll datasets

POS on Conll.ipynb (jupyter notebook): shows data loading, model construction, training and evaluation

POS_on_Conll.py (python script): refactored from the notebook, has structured utility functions, the main section also constructs, trains and evaluates a POS tagging model.


Starting from scratch:
1. go to data folder, execute Conll_data_preprocessing.py to generate preprocessed data (already there by default)
2. execute POS_on_Conll.py to build and evaluate a POS tagging model
