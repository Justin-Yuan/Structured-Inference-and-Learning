- practical3.pdf contains assignment instructions from the Oxford NLP courses practical3 and model architectures (only for the first part on text classification, the second part for language modelling is still being developed).

- practical3-clean.ipynb is the refactored and cleaned completion. 

- models folder contains trained tensorflow models for the assignment. 

- experiments folder contains variants of the text classification architectures including GRU, LSTM_final_state, Bidirectional_LSTM, etc
